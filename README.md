# Genius

This is an extremelly simple implementation of the "Genius" game (similar to Hasbro's Simon).

The code was used in my Object Oriented Programming classes and it's very commented (in portuguese). The code is 
intentionally left simple, with no menus, game endings or other polishing features that could distract the student 
from the game logic itself. Nevertheless, it's design with a object oriented structure that allow a teacher to explain 
different OO concepts and thinking.

The project can algo be used to explain a simple game structure and basic game proggraming concepts. 
It has a simple game loop, objects with simple state machines, and some timing control.
